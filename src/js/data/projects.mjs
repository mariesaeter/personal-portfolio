      "An accommodation booking site where you can view venues and register a user either as a customer or a manager. As a customer you can book a venue and see your upcoming stays, and as a venue manager you can create new venues, view bookings made to your venues, as well as update and delete your venue. To be more on the creative side Ive chosen to make the accommodation booking site into a booking site for venues inspired by books and movies.",
